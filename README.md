## Concept and Inspire

**Build Your Own Redis with C/C++** \
1. Why build Redis? \
The knowledge required is broader and deeper than usual application-level development. It's a good way to level up your skills (mainly network programming and data structures).
2. Why from scratch? \
A quote from Richard Feynman: “What I cannot create, I do not understand”. Human understandings are filled with holes aka “things I don't know I don't know”. Building from scratch is a way to ensure your understanding is complete. \
You can read more about details from [Build Your Own](https://build-your-own.org/).
